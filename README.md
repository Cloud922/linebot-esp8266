# Deploy LINE Bot NodeJS Examples on Render

This repo can be used to deploy nodejs examples in the [line-bot-sdk-nodejs](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-nodejs/tree/master/examples) on [Render](https://render.com/).
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following:
- A dedicated [Messaging API channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/getting-started/) for your bot.
- A [Render account](https://dashboard.render.com/register) that doesn't require credit card to sign up.

## Deployment
1. Fork this repo.
2. Update `render.yaml` to comment/uncomment the services of LINE bot examples you want to deploy.
3. Cieck to deploy

4. You will be prompted to input LINE channel secret and [access token](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/channel-access-tokens/). You can find them on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/). Channel secret is on the channel's `Basic settings` tab. Channel access token is on the channel's `Messaging API` tab.
5. Once the bot servcie is live, find the service `onrender` URL (e.g., `https://line-bot-nodejs-<something unique>.onrender.com`) on the Dashboard. Append `/callback` to the service URL to build the webhook URL (e.g., `https://line-bot-nodejs-<something unique>.onrender.com/callback`). Paste the webhook URL to the `Webhook settings` section on the LINE channel's `Messaging API` tab on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/). Also enable `Use webhook` on the same section.
   > For the `line-bot-nodejs-echo-ts` example, the webhook URL is `https://line-bot-nodejs-<something unique>.onrender.com/webhook`
7. Add the LINE Official Account associated with your bot as a friend on LINE by scanning the QR code on the `Messaging API` tab of your channel settings on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/).
8. That's it. Send your LINE Official Account a text message on LINE and confirm that it responds with the same message.

## Notes
- If your LINE bot app files are in the same repo as `render.yaml`, you don't need to specify `repo` in the `render.yaml`. You can find more information in the [Render Blueprint spec](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec#repo--branch).
- If you copy the [kitchensink example files](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-nodejs/tree/next/examples/kitchensink) to your repo, remember to update the `@line/bot-sdk` dependency in the `package.json` from local to npm.
